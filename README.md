This project will involve a variety of tools and programming languages to achieve the desired outcome. Here's a breakdown of the project's proposed structure and how it can be developed:

Backend: A PostgreSQL database will be used to store the data. The database will be pre-populated with the necessary information on each rhythm code. A Node.js and Express server will be responsible for interacting with the database and providing the data to the frontend.

Frontend: The frontend will be built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website will feature an interactive multimedia map with markers representing the rhythm codes. Each marker will be clickable, allowing users to view a list of related rhythms and their corresponding media content.

Database Schema: The database will contain two tables, one for the rhythm codes and another for the rhythms themselves. The rhythm codes table will have columns for the unique identifier of each code, the name of the code, and the coordinates of the marker on the map. The rhythms table will have columns for the unique identifier of each rhythm, the title of the rhythm, a URL linking to more information about the rhythm, and the coordinates of the marker on the map.

Data Seeding: The database will be seeded with data using a seed file, which will contain SQL commands to insert the necessary information into the database. This seed file will be used each time the project is started to ensure that the database has the latest data.

Docker Deployment: The project will be deployed using Docker, a tool that simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and running applications. A standalone Docker container will be used to deploy the PostgreSQL database. The container will be configured to run automatically whenever the project is started.

NPM Commands: The project will include a series of NPM commands that can be used to automate various tasks. These commands will be stored in a "scripts" section of the project's "package.json" file. For example, the "npm run dev" command will be used to start the project in development mode, while the "npm run docker:stop" command will be used to stop the Docker container.

Deployment: The project will be hosted on Render, a cloud platform that specializes in hosting static websites and serverless applications.
